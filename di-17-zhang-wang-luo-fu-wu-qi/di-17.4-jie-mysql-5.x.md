# 第 17.4 节 MySQL 5.X

## mysql 5.5/5.6

### 安装

现在源里已经没有了，参见 <https://www.freshports.org/databases/mysql56-server>、<https://www.freshports.org/databases/mysql55-server>。

可以拉取旧版的 ports 编译安装：

-  mysql 5.6：


```shell
# git clone https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-ports /usr/ports
# cd  /usr/ports && git checkout 5u623l20
# cd /usr/ports/databases/mysql56-server/ && make install clean
```

- mysql 5.5

```shell
# git clone https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-ports /usr/ports
# cd  /usr/ports && git checkout 9f0ff92
# cd /usr/ports/databases/mysql55-server/ && make install clean
```

### 启动服务

```shell
# sysrc mysql_enable="YES"
# service mysql-server start
```

### 配置

```shell
# mysql_secure_installation
```

输出：

```shell
root@ykla:~ # mysql_secure_installation


NOTE: RUNNING ALL PARTS OF THIS SCRIPT IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL MySQL
      SERVERS IN PRODUCTION USE!  PLEASE READ EACH STEP CAREFULLY!

In order to log into MySQL to secure it, we'll need the current
password for the root user.  If you've just installed MySQL, and
you haven't set the root password yet, the password will be blank,
so you should just press enter here.


Enter current password for root (enter for none):
OK, successfully used password, moving on...

Setting the root password ensures that nobody can log into the MySQL
root user without the proper authorisation.

Set root password? [Y/n] y
New password:
Re-enter new password:
Password updated successfully!
Reloading privilege tables..
 ... Success!


By default, a MySQL installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone
to log into MySQL without having to have a user account created for
them.  This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation
go a bit smoother.  You should remove them before moving into a
production environment.

Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] y
 ... Success!

Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'.  This
ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network.

Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] n
 ... skipping.

By default, MySQL comes with a database named 'test' that anyone can
access.  This is also intended only for testing, and should be removed
before moving into a production environment.

Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] n
 ... skipping.

Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes made so far
will take effect immediately.

Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n]
 ... Success!




All done!  If you've completed all of the above steps, your MySQL
installation should now be secure.

Thanks for using MySQL!


Cleaning up...
